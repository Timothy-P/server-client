# Differences
This version is a back-and-forth between the server and client. The bare-bones one is just a one-way.
# Usage
It's just the same thing. When you click enter/return (depends on what's printed on your keyboard), it'll give the other user a chance to send something.
# Why?
I don't know. I just decided to do it because I was trying to make something for the client to know if the server disconnected, but ended up with this.
