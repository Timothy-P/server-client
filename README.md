# server-client
A python script that's quite bare bones, but I'm going to make it more user-friendly. Stay tuned.
# server-client-bare
I haven't done much to make this advanced, as it's just user-friendly as I can make it. It displays the server's IP and port and the client can connect to the server's port (if I get it working).
# server-client-friendly
This hasn't been started, but I plan on making a UI using [Tkinter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tkinter-tutorial/). This will take longer than the bare bones version, as I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to Tkinter. If you want progress updates and such, [let me know](https://github.com/Timothy-P/Timothy-P).
